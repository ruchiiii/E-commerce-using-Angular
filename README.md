This is a simple E-commerce application built using Angular. I have created it in the process to refresh my Angular concepts. This application has a MyStore page where you can all products listed with image, price, name and number to stocks left.
Upon clicking 'Add to Cart', product will be added in the Cart. When you click on cart, it displays shopping cart with all products added to cart, total summary of products and option to proceed to checkout. It also has an option remove product.

I have refreshed all basics concept while creatiing this project.
